<h2 style = "font-size 300%;"> INFO: </h2>
<p> For this assignment I decided to use a Hash Map to insert the lyrics to my song as keys. A hash map enabled for a quick insertion of my data as it was put in a while loop to count the frequency of specific words that appeared. 
It also allows for data to be easily reached when needed. However a hash map can't be organized without the help of other data structures. I decided to create a list that would read in my hash maps data and organize the data from 
the most frequent appearing words to the least frequent; with the use of the Collections.sort command (allows for a quick sorting of data). Once the list sorts the word frequency, it is then reverted back into another hash map. 
However it's a linked hash map which unlike a hash map takes in data with the use of keys, but it retains the order of the given data. In this case it allows for the data to stay sorted. 
Finally with the use of for loop, my program will print each key of the hash map into a separate text file as its output.
My program also implements the Kumo library which reads the output files contents and creates a word cloud. If I were given more time, I would like to use CSS to make my final webpage more detailed and complex. 
Using image panning, pop ups and many more features.</p>

<p> I decided to use the song "Paint it Black" because I simply enjoy the song. I find it increadbily catchy, and love
the lyrics to it. It was written and performed by the Rolling Stones in 1966, and in the same year hit the US Billboard
top hits. The word "black" was repeated many times during the song, which wasn't a suprise. It's in the title
of the song, and is one of the biggest focuses around the song.</p>
